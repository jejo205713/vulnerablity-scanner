VULNERABLITY-SCANNER:

This Python script utilizes the nmap library to automate a vulnerability scan for a given network address. It defines a function, perform_vuln_scan, which conducts both service version detection and vulnerability scans. The scan results, including host information, open ports, and any identified vulnerabilities, are then printed. The script prompts the user to input the target network address and executes the scan, emphasizing the importance of obtaining proper authorization before scanning any network.

the project also has other goals of futher devoloping this script will be updated in future ...
